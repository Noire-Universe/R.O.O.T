Thank you for playing R.O.O.T

***********************
* Running Out Of Time *
***********************

Infinity is angry because there is never enough time. So it (infinity) is trying to temper with it (time), shattering time
itself in the process.
Driven by panic and guilt, Infinity is trying to put time back together. To do this it has to collect the shattered time
fragments (trapped in platforms) before time has run out and everything comes to a halt.

There is not much more to this game but here are some key information that
may turn out to be helpful:
Currently R.O.O.T only works on the Windows platform, feel free to try and running it some place else, but do this
at your own risk. 
You are playing a beta version, so the chances that you encounter some weird behaviour are quite big, however, please
should you encounter some behaviour that does not seem to be intentionally, please let us know!

Version: beta1.1:
	 * - Custom font now can be displayed by the game properly
	 * - A "Readme.txt" file has been added to the project
	 

I am fully aware of that most people do not bother reading "Readme.txt" files so this is a great place to hide information
in plane sight! Know this: Although R.O.O.T is capable of detecting the screen size and adjust itself accordingly the actual
game field itself does not change. This was a deliberate decision! ...because we wanted to utilise the side-effect that on a 
smaller screen size (which generally would indicate an older computer system) playing the game gets a little bit easier. Since
R.O.O.T is a tribute to the old-school platform games of times past, we thought it a nice touch if players with computer
systems that have been build closer to these 'good old times' would be rewarded. They usually are punished enough with things
they can not do (anymore) with their machines.
